    <h1>Sam's Food Diary: Jun 2019</h1>
    <div class="intro">
      <p>Welcome to my food blog for the month of June 2019. I'm using this to track my food intake and exercise for the month so that I can reach my daily calorie and fitness goals.</p>

      <p>For breakfast, I had an asiago cheese bagel with butter, about 1 cup of yogurt, and some coffee.</p>
      <p>For lunch/dinner, I had half a Chipotle Sofritas burrito bowl with brown rice, veggies, corn, salsa, sour cream, cheese, and lettuce. I also had a diet coke.</p>
      <p>I did not exercise today because I was quite busy with my coding practice for Epicodus.</p>
